# UI Prototype

Generate **several radically different UI variations** on a single route, switchable from a floating bottom bar. The user flips between variants in the browser, picks one (or steals bits from each), then throws the rest away.

If the question is about logic/state rather than what something looks like — wrong branch. Use [LOGIC.md](LOGIC.md).

## When this is the right shape

- "What should this page look like?"
- "I want to see a few options for this dashboard before committing."
- "Try a different layout for the settings screen."
- Any time the user would otherwise spend a day picking between three vague mockups in their head.

## Two sub-shapes — strongly prefer sub-shape A

A UI prototype is much easier to judge when it's **butting up against the rest of the app** — real header, real sidebar, real data, real density. A throwaway route on its own is a vacuum: every variant looks fine in isolation. Default to sub-shape A whenever there's a plausible existing page to host the variants. Only reach for sub-shape B if the prototype genuinely has no nearby home.

### Sub-shape A — adjustment to an existing page (preferred)

The route already exists. Variants render **on the same route** only in development and with a recognized `?variant=` value. Missing or invalid selection and all production requests retain the original page. Preserve existing read-only data fetching, params, and auth; stub prototype mutations.

If the prototype is for something that doesn't yet have a page but *would naturally live inside one* (a new section of the dashboard, a new card on the settings screen, a new step in an existing flow) — that's still sub-shape A. Mount the variants inside the host page.

### Sub-shape B — a new page (last resort)

Only use this when the thing being prototyped genuinely has no existing page to live inside — e.g. an entirely new top-level surface, or a flow that can't be embedded anywhere sensible.

Create a **throwaway route** following whatever routing convention the project already uses — don't invent a new top-level structure. Name it so it's obviously a prototype (e.g. include the word `prototype` in the path or filename). Same `?variant=` pattern.

Before committing to sub-shape B, sanity-check: is there really no existing page this could be embedded in? An empty route hides design problems that a populated one would expose.

In both sub-shapes the floating bottom bar is identical.

## Process

### 1. State the question and pick N

Default to **3 variants**. More than 5 stops being radically different and starts being noise — cap there.

Write down the plan in one line, in the prototype's location or a top-of-file comment:

> "Three variants of the settings page, switchable via `?variant=`, on the existing `/settings` route."

This works whether the user is here to push back or not.

### 2. Generate radically different variants

Draft each variant. Hold each one to:

- The page's purpose and the data it has access to.
- The project's component library / styling system (TailwindCSS, shadcn, MUI, plain CSS, whatever).
- A clear exported component name, e.g. `VariantA`, `VariantB`, `VariantC`.

Variants must be **structurally different** — different layout, different information hierarchy, different primary affordance, not just different colours. Three slightly-tweaked card grids isn't a UI prototype, it's wallpaper. If two drafts come out too similar, redo one with explicit "do not use a card grid" guidance.

### 3. Wire them together

Create a single switcher component on the route:

```tsx
// Existing-page example: use the framework's development flag and router.
const variant = searchParams.get('variant');
if (!isDevelopment || (variant !== 'A' && variant !== 'B' && variant !== 'C')) {
  return <OriginalPage {...data} />;
}
const SelectedVariant = { A: VariantA, B: VariantB, C: VariantC }[variant];
return (
  <>
    <SelectedVariant {...data} />
    <PrototypeSwitcher variants={['A','B','C']} current={variant} />
  </>
);
```

For sub-shape A (existing page): keep all the existing data fetching above the switcher; only the rendered subtree changes per variant.

For sub-shape B (new page): use the framework's development-only route mechanism or a server/router guard that returns not found outside development. Within development, the route may default to A. If reliable isolation is unavailable, use an isolated local preview instead of modifying application routing.

### 4. Build the floating switcher

A small fixed-position bar at the bottom-centre of the screen with three pieces:

- **Left arrow** — cycles to the previous variant (wraps around).
- **Variant label** — shows the current variant key and, if the variant exports a name, that name too. e.g. `B — Sidebar layout`.
- **Right arrow** — cycles forward (wraps around).

Behaviour:

- Clicking an arrow updates the URL search param (use the framework's router — `router.replace` on Next, `navigate` on React Router, etc) so the variant is shareable and reload-stable.
- Keyboard: `←` and `→` arrow keys also cycle. Don't intercept arrow keys when an `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `[contenteditable]` is focused.
- Visually distinct from the page (e.g. high-contrast pill, subtle shadow) so it's obviously not part of the design being evaluated.
- Gate the entire prototype surface, including variants and routes, using the framework's development mechanism; hiding only this bar is insufficient.

Keep one switcher within the prototype's files, shared by its variants. Do not add it to the application's general component library.

### 5. Hand it over

Check variant switching, reload behavior, keyboard focus, representative content, and a narrow viewport. For an existing page, verify missing or invalid selection preserves the original page, including all production requests. For a new prototype page, verify missing or invalid selection uses the documented development default or selection prompt, and the route is unavailable in production. Report checks actually run and any limits, then provide the URL and variant keys for user evaluation.

### 6. Capture the answer and clean up

Record the selected structure or combination, the user's reason, observations, and remaining uncertainty using the main skill's output contract. Keep the experiment available while evaluation is pending. After evaluation, unless the user wants to retain it:

- **Sub-shape A** — remove all prototype variants and wiring; restore ordinary rendering without overwriting subsequent user changes.
- **Sub-shape B** — remove the throwaway route, variants, and switcher.

Verify ordinary routing after cleanup. Integrating the selected design is a separate authorized implementation task, not a cleanup step.

## Anti-patterns

- **Variants that differ only in colour or copy.** That's a tweak, not a prototype. Real variants disagree about structure.
- **Sharing too much code between variants.** A shared `<Header>` is fine; a shared `<Layout>` defeats the point. Each variant should be free to throw out the layout.
- **Wiring variants to real mutations.** Read-only prototypes are fine. If a variant needs to mutate, point it at a stub — the question is "what should this look like", not "does the backend work".
- **Promoting the prototype directly to production.** Selection establishes a design preference, not implementation approval or production quality.
